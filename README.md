# FizzBuzz Problem

“FizzBuzz” is a sometimes used as a coding exercise during interviews to check logical skills of developers.

__Problem__

It goes like this:

```
Write a program that prints the numbers 1-100.
If the number is divisible by 3, print "fizz" instead of the number.
If the number is divisible by 5, print "buzz" instead of the number.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz" instead of the number.
```

## My Take

There are a ton of ways to solve fizzbuzz problem, with many different programing languages. I took the most abstract and reusable approach in C#.
